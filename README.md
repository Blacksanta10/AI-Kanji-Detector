## How to Use
The included files only have code. Use these to generate a dataset, train the
model, and then use the model.

First, a python virtual environment should be started (MacOS/Linux):
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

The dependencies can be installed by running the following:
```
python3 install.py
```

Next a dataset will need to be generated with a script. This dataset will be
generated by loading the fonts provided in the project. The script applies
distortion and saves them to a .npz file to use later.
```
python3 generate_modern.py
```

Pull samples from the dataset by running the extract script:
```
python3 extract.py
```

Train the model with:
```
python3 kanjiCNN.py
```

The script autodetects for a GPU, if none a CPU is used.

Ensure that a camera is connected to the device before running either script.

Run the prediction script:
```
python3 predictor.py
```

Run the translator script:
```
python3 translator.py
```
