2. Go to Phone Settings --> Connected Devices --> USB Preferences, give access to Webcam
3. Go to Computer Settings --> Bluetooth & Devices --> Cameras, you should see that your phone's webcam is an option


-- Problem Specification 
	- Only limited to Japanese Kanji
	- Can not do combination kanji translations


-- Agent Design
	-Performance, Environment, Actuators, Sensors


-- Dataset information
  - Kuzushiji-MNIST translates kanji into hiragana (Japanese alphabet).
  - download data in Numpy format
  - easier to handle and use tools 

-- How to train the model??
  - Make a CNN using pytorch
	- Make CNN layers that transform the input data(kanji picture)
	-Datasets: training, test data
	-Optimizer: model's internal weights
	-Cost function: model predictions vs. true
	-Metrics: performance, accuracy, etc.
